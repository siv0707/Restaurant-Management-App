# Restaurant Management Application 🍽️

A multi-platform application designed to streamline restaurant operations and management.

---

## 📌 Overview  
This application is built using **Java**, **PHP**, **MySQL**, and an **Apache server (via XAMPP)**.  
It serves as a unified system to manage restaurant data — categories, menu items, orders, and more — with real-time updates and data synchronization. The desktop component is built in Java for robust local operations, while the backend is powered by PHP connected to a MySQL database.
